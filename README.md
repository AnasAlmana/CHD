# 🫀 AI-Based Early Detection of Congenital Heart Defects (CHDs)

This project presents a complete AI-based system for the **early detection of Congenital Heart Defects (CHDs)** from medical images. It leverages deep learning to support clinicians, especially in low-resource settings, by providing fast, interpretable, and scalable diagnostic tools.

---

## 📌 Motivation

Congenital Heart Defects are the most common type of birth defect globally. However:

- Early detection is challenging, especially in infants
- There’s a shortage of experienced pediatric cardiologists
- Conventional diagnostic tools (e.g., MRI, echocardiograms) are expensive and expert-dependent

This system offers an affordable, AI-assisted diagnostic pipeline deployable in rural clinics, mobile screening units, or telemedicine platforms.

## 🧠 System Components

### 1. Image Preprocessing
Standardizes medical images (e.g., X-rays, echo frames):
- Converts to grayscale
- Applies normalization and resizing
- Optimized for CNN input

### 2. Transfer Learning–Based Classifier
- Fine-tuned **ResNet50** architecture
- Classifies 4 categories:  
  `Normal`, `Atrial Septal Defect (ASD)`, `Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD)`, `Patent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA)`

### 3. GAN-Augmented Dataset
- Addresses class imbalance for rare CHD types
- Uses **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** to create synthetic examples

### 4. Explainability with Grad-CAM
- Visual explanations highlight important image regions
- Supports transparency and clinician trust in AI predictions

### 5. Web-Based Interface (Prototype)
- Upload → Predict → Visual Explanation
- Simulates integration into clinical workflow
